   20.   There is a book library. Define classes respectively for a book and a library. The library
   must contain a name and a list of books. The books must contain the title, author, publisher,
   release date and ISBN-number. In the class, which describes the library, create methods to add a
   book to the library, to search for a book by a predefined author, to display information about a
   book and to delete a book from the library.

   21.   Write a test class, which creates an object of type library, adds several books to it and
   displays information about each of them. Implement a test functionality, which finds all books
   authored by Stephen King and deletes them. Finally, display information for each of the remaining
   books.
