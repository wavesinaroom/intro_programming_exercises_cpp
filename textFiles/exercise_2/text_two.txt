 'Is it then that you have reached such a degree of lethargy that you acquiesce in your sickness?
   If so, let us
   flee to lands that are analogues of death. I see how it is, poor soul! We shall pack our trunks
   for Tornio. Let us go
   farther still to the extreme end of the Baltic; or farther still from life, if that is possible;
   let us settle at the Pole. There
   the sun only grazes the earth obliquely, and the slow alternation of light and darkness
   suppresses variety and
   increases monotony, that half-nothingness. There we shall be able to take long baths of darkness,
   while for our
   amusement the aurora borealis shall send us its rose-coloured rays that are like the reflection
   of Hell's own
   fireworks!'
   At last my soul explodes, and wisely cries out to me: 'No matter where! No matter where! As long
   as it's out
   of the world!
