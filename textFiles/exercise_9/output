From faires1t creatures we des1ire increas1e,
But as the riper s1hould by time deceas1e,
But thou contracted to thine owne bright eyes,
Making a famine where aboundance lies,
Thou that art now the worlds fres1h ornament,
Within thine owne bud buries1t thy content,
Pitty the world,or els1e this glutton be,
