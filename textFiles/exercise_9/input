From faires1t creatures we des1ire increas1e,
That thereby beauties Ros1e might neuer die,
But as the riper s1hould by time deceas1e,
His tender heire might beare his memory:
But thou contracted to thine owne bright eyes,
Feed's1t thy lights flame with s1elfe s1ubs1tantiall fewell,
Making a famine where aboundance lies,
Thy s1elfe thy foe,to thy s1weet s1elfe too cruell:
Thou that art now the worlds fres1h ornament,
And only herauld to the gaudy s1pring,
Within thine owne bud buries1t thy content,
And tender chorle maks1t was1t in niggarding:
Pitty the world,or els1e this glutton be,
To eate the worlds due,by the graue and thee.
