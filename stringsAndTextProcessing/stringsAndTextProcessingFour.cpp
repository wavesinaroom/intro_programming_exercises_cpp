/*How many backslashes you must specify as an argument to the method Split(â€¦)
in order to split the text by a backslash?

Example: one\two\three.

Note: In C# backslash is an escaping character.*/

HOWEVER, SOMEBODY WORKED ON THIS IMPLEMENTATION:

WHERE USERS MUST SPECIFY THE SPLITING POINT JUST ONCE*/
