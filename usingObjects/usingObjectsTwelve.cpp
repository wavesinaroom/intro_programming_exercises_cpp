/* Write a program, which calculates the value of a given numeral 
  expression given as a string. The numeral expression consists of:

-     real numbers, for example 5, 18.33, 3.14159, 12.6;

-     arithmetic operations: +, -, *, / (with their standard priorities);

-     mathematical functions: ln(x), sqrt(x), pow(x, y);

-     brackets for changing the priorities of the operations: ( and ).

Note that the numeral expressions have priorities,
 for example the expression 
 -1 + 2 + 3 * 4 - 0.5 = (-1) + 2 + (3 * 4) - 0.5 = 12.5.*/
